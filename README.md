# Python-Hotkeys
A collection of convenient python scripts that can be called via hotkeys
This version of Python-Hotkeys is intended to be used exclusively through compiled python executables.
The advantage of this is naturally that windows computers without a python interpreter will be able to use this software completely dependency free.
This does pose the added security risk inherent to exe's, so for the security conscious who still want to use this software without a python interpreter, I would recommend manually converting the provided python scripts to exe on a computer with a compiler.
Keep in mind that while the scripts have been provided for this purpose, this version of Python-Hotkeys should be able to function with only the executables.
