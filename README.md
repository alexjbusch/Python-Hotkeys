# Python-Hotkeys
A collection of convenient python scripts that can be called via hotkeys.

### Instructions For Use
To start the listener, simply run listener.pyw, which initially listens only for the activation hotkey. The activation hotkey is "CTRL_RIGHT  CTRL_LEFT  CTRL_RIGHT", which when pressed will bring up the gui and begin listening for hotkeys tied to scripts.  From the gui you can run default scripts, add your own, modify existing hotkeys, and most importantly trigger scripts via keypresses.  Be advised that listener.pyw doesn't terminate after the gui is closed, so currently it will have to be closed manually from task manager or the terminal.  Future updates will include a config file and/or a settings gui that will let you change the activation hotkey, select preferences for when the listener terminates, and toggle whether the gui pops up or not.

Python-Hotkeys lets you create your own hotkeys and bind them however you want, but the following scripts have been added as defaults:
## test.py
This script merely prints out "Your hotkey is working" in an infinite loop.  Useful for testing purposes when adding your own hotkeys.

## sitRepScript
sitRepScript is meant to act as a centralized way to quickly check if media you're following has new content without actually having to navigate to any websites.  It currently only checks for how many xkcd comics have come out since you last ran the script, but future updates will include checking for new gmail or facebook messages, other webcomics such as smbc, new episodes of shows on netflix, and new youtube videos from specific channels.  If all media are up to date, the popup will simply display the text "All Current".  Otherwise it will print out a set of links announcing how many new content objects have come out.  When the links are clicked, they open up google chrome and navigate automatically to the new media in question.  Future updates may include support for Firefox and Safari but not Microsoft Edge (for moral reasons).  

This software uses python scripts, and thus requires a python interpreter.
If youâ€™re interested in using this software on a windows computer without python installed, you should check out the dependency free version of this software in the All-EXE branch:
