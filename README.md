# Python-Hotkeys
A collection of convenient python scripts that can be called via hotkeys.

This software uses python scripts, and thus requires a python interpreter.
If youâ€™re interested in using this software on a windows computer without python installed, you should check out the dependency free version of this software in the All-EXE branch:
